<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Florence Ibeabuchi,and I'm an aspiring web developer currently learning web development and building my skills one step at a time.</p>

<p>I decided to start this journey because i'm curious about how website work and i want to be able to ceate my own projects someday.I'm currently taking an amazing course by Dr.Angela Yu that's helping to learn from the ground up.</p>

<p>Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new ideas,learning online, and being creative. I'm still discovering what area of web development I'll focus on,but i'm excited for the journey ahead.</p>

<p>Thanks for visting my Portfolio</p>
